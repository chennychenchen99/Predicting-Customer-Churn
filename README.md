# Prediction and Analysis of Customer Churn
HW2 for CSE145 - Intro to Data Mining

The goal of this assignment was to analyze the dataset, find a high-quality clustering using K-means to describe some common properties, and build two different models to predict whether the customers churned.

## Data
The dataset contains information about 20,000 examples over 12 variables describing features of customers of a mobile phone provider. Customer churn signifies which customers have stopped using one company's product or service during a certain time frame.  The fileâ€™s fields include data on each customer, Which includes their education, income, value of house, their monthly usage situation (like the number of over 15mins calls, average call duration), and whether they churned within a month when the data was captured. It is assumed that the data was uniformly sampled from the full database.
